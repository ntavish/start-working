This is a small script to get you quickly start working. If you 
often find yourself opening the same set of programs, documents,
and various such sets (i.e. different projects), then you will
probably find this useful.

Usage:

start-working.sh work
start-working.sh project

To configure the profile 'work':
Create a directory named 'work' in the script directory.
Create two files in that directory=> APPS, and DOCS

Write the commands to launch the programs you want
to run in the work profile, one in each line of APPS.

Write the name of documents to be opened in APPS. These
will be opened using gnome-open.

Requirements:
Linux, bash, gnome desktop
